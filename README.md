# 2048
Recreated the popular game 2048 for my CS 324e (Graphics and Visualization) final group project. Personally, I was mainly resonsible for the 'About' page, integrating multiple themes (drake theme is my personal fav) and their respective songs, and the gameplay GUI (inclding buttons, toggles, graphics, and pause screen). I also helped design the gameplay board with my partner.
